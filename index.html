<p><img src="/images/start.png" alt="ff">  sdgd</p>

<p>Little Red Riding Block is a 2D Jump´n´Run Game in which you take control over a little block-shaped character named Little Red Riding Block.<br>
This sweet little Block is on her way to visit her sick Grandmother and bring her Flowers to cheer her up.<br>
You have to get to your Grandmothers House hidden deep in the dark forest and bring her the flowers you have picked during your journey to her.<br>
But be careful! Also a vicious wolf hunts in these woods. So don´t waste too much time to get to your Granny. Otherwise the wolf might get you.<br>
During your Journey through this odd and dangerous wood you might find a few strange but helpful items to help you on your way to Grannys House.
You will find sweet little Cupcakes which will grant you a Speed Boost. Wine to give you a littlebit of extra time.<br>
And Baskets to be able to carry more Flowers.<br>
Each Flower you have gathered is worth 10 Points and every second you have left when you reach the Grandmothers House is also added to your score.<br>
The Goal of the game is so reach the House in time and with the highest score.</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
