Also a vicious wolf hunts in these woods. So don´t waste too much time to get to your Granny. Otherwise the wolf might get you.  \r\nDuring your Journey through this odd and dangerous wood you might find a few strange but helpful items to help you on your way to Grannys House.\r\nYou will find sweet little Cupcakes which will grant you a Speed Boost. Wine to give you a littlebit of extra time.  \r\nAnd Baskets to be able to carry more Flowers.    \r\nEach Flower you have gathered is worth 10 Points and every second you have left when you reach the Grandmothers House is also added to your score.  \r\nThe Goal of the game is so reach the House in time and with the highest score.\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\n* Programming Language: C#\r\n* Framework: Monogames\r\n* IDE: Visual Studio 2012\r\n* Single - Person Project  \r\n* Programming, Concept and all Graphics were made by myself.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Walking Styx\r\n_In Work (Alpha Phase)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
